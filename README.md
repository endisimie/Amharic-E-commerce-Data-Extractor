# Amharic-E-commerce-Data-Extractor

This project is part of **EthioMart's initiative** to build a centralized Telegram-based e-commerce platform for Ethiopia. It focuses on extracting key business entities â€” such as **product names**, **prices**, and **locations** â€” from Amharic text shared in Telegram channels.
